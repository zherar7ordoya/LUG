# multilingual-UI-winforms
This project shows how to apply multilingual (multilanguage) UI design according to the language setting set by the user.

This is a dummy project to test how to apply multilingual UI design in C#, WinForms. 

I used resource files (resx) to store translated values of the UI texts for both Turkish and English. Please check Resources folder.

Preferred application language is stored in the Settings of the app and this can be changed from the UI.

Since this is a dummy project, please don't expect so many logical functions. :)
